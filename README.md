# About me


**candaceinkansas/candaceinkansas** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on my Champlain College Online capstone project.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to use the GitHub repository.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I am very much looking forward to completing my degree so I will once again be free to enjoy living life during my evenings and weekends outside of work.
